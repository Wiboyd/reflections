?? What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
===========
Initializing a repo creates a .git directory to store informations and metadata
that git uses to recall different versions. So we have to do it to tell git to prepare
itself to receive commits for that directory.


?? How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
===========
The staging area collects files that git should look at. It is a part of the working
directory in a way. It allows to add files to git without adding the whole directory,
and therefor have more control over what git is watching for you.
