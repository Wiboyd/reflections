?? What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
===========
Initializing a repo creates a .git directory to store informations and metadata
that git uses to recall different versions. So we have to do it to tell git to prepare
itself to receive commits for that directory.


?? How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
===========
The staging area collects files that git should look at. It is a part of the working
directory in a way. It allows to add files to git without adding the whole directory,
and therefor have more control over what git is watching for you.


?? How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
===========
Before ever committing changes, we should run git diff --staged in order to see
exactly what we changed compared to the last commit. Then we can be sure we intend
every of those changes and write a consistent commit message.


?? What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
===========
When testing ideas about new features that are not "official" and only in experimental
state. Then we can side by side develop that idea and the "production" branch and merge
them when the new feature is well tested and ready to be included. Branches help keep
everything clean and organized, and most of all, safe.


?? How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
===========
It helped visuallising reachability in a clear way. Plus, it helps seeing what changes happened on a branch while another was developped further.
