?? When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
============
The remote repo helps collaborating with other developers and keep track of changes
you issue from different computers.

?? Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
===========
When working on your local machine, you don't want content to get pulled and that changes
what you are working on without asking. This would be a complete mess. Similarily, you
don't want to push unfinished work on remote as other people would not be able to understand
what you did. So keeping control on push and pull is definitely the right way to do.
